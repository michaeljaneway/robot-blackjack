# Robot Blackjack

![Cool Robot](https://github.com/Happyfacemike/robot-blackjack/blob/master/readme_files/cool%20robot.gif)

A barebones prototype for a topdown 2D RPG Blackjack game built on a Python GUI library(Sounds odd but I'll make it work).
Currently on hold due to school and work.

Currently features:
* WASD controlled animated robot

* Full player collision

* A seperate rooms.py program that holds the roomtype data as well, as functioning as a quick way to draw room collision boxes when run

* A room navigation system, allowing the player to enter and leave different rooms

* A fully interchangeable map matrix that will allow for easy map layout, as well as easy testing of future rooms
